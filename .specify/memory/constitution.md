# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
# Windsona Personality Test Static Website Constitution

## Core Principles


### I. Static-First Delivery
All features MUST be delivered as static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) suitable for deployment on any static host. No server-side dependencies allowed.

### II. Mobile-First & Responsive
All pages MUST be designed for mobile-first and be fully responsive. Desktop support is required but secondary.

### III. Minimal Dependencies
Only essential libraries (React, Tailwind, Vite) are permitted. Additional dependencies require explicit justification and review.

### IV. Testable & Independently Deployable
Each user-facing feature MUST be independently testable and deployable. No feature may break or block others.

### V. Simplicity & Clarity
Code and UI MUST be simple, clear, and easy to understand. Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering.



## Requirements

- MUST use React JS for all UI components.
- MUST use Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
- MUST use Vite for build and deployment.
- MUST deliver as a static site (no backend/server code).
- MUST support mobile and desktop browsers.
- MUST include basic accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation).

## Workflow & Quality Gates

- All code changes MUST be reviewed before merging.
- All features MUST be independently testable (manual or automated).
- All deployments MUST be static and verifiable by opening index.html locally.
- Any new dependency MUST be justified and approved.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices for this project. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance. Simplicity and clarity are required for all changes.
